config EXT4_FS

	select CRC16
	help
	  This is the next generation of the ext3 filesystem.

	  Unlike the change from ext2 filesystem to ext3 filesystem,
	  the on-disk format of ext4 is not forwards compatible with
	  ext3; it is based on extent maps and it supports 48-bit
	  physical block numbers.  The ext4 filesystem also supports delayed
	  allocation, persistent preallocation, high resolution time stamps,
	  and a number of other features to improve performance and speed
	  up fsck time.  For more information, please see the web pages at
	  http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org.

	  The ext4 filesystem will support mounting an ext3
	  filesystem; while there will be some performance gains from
	  the delayed allocation and inode table readahead, the best
	  performance gains will require enabling ext4 features in the
	  filesystem, or formatting a new filesystem as an ext4
	  filesystem initially.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here. The
	  module will be called ext4.

	  If unsure, say N.

	default y
	help
	  Allow the ext4 file system driver code to be used for ext2 or

	  Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes by
	  the kernel or by users (see the attr(5) manual page, or visit
	  <http://acl.bestbits.at/> for details).

	  If unsure, say N.

	  You need this for POSIX ACL support on ext4.

	depends on EXT4_FS_XATTR
	help
	  Security labels support alternative access control models
	  implemented by security modules like SELinux.  This option
	  enables an extended attribute handler for file security
	  labels in the ext4 filesystem.

	  If you are not using a security module that requires using

	default y
	help
	  Before every meta data buffer write, the journal API is called,

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_FILE
	bool "snapshot file"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT
	default y

	  read-only address space ops.

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_FILE_READ
	bool "snapshot file - read through to block device"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_FILE
	default y
	help
	  On active snapshot file page read, the function ext4_get_block()
	  is called to map the page to a disk block.  If the page is not mapped
	  in the snapshot file a direct mapping to the block device is returned.

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_FILE_PERM
	bool "snapshot file - permissions"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_FILE

	  Snapshot inode is stored differently in memory and on disk.
	  During store and load of snapshot inode, some of the inode flags
	  and fields are converted.

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_FILE_HUGE
	bool "snapshot file - increase maximum file size limit to 16TB"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_FILE
	default y
	help
	  Files larger than 2TB use Ext4 huge_file flag to store i_blocks
	  in file system blocks units, so the upper limit on snapshot actual
	  size is increased from 512*2^32 = 2TB to 4K*2^32 = 16TB,
	  which is also the upper limit on file system size.
	  To map 2^32 logical blocks, 4 triple indirect blocks are used instead
	  of just one.  The extra 3 triple indirect blocks are stored in-place
	  of direct blocks, which are not in use by snapshot files.

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_FILE_OLD
	bool "snapshot file - migrate old on-disk format"

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK
	bool "snapshot block operations"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_FILE
	default y
	help
	  Core implementation of special snapshot file block operations.
	  The argument @create to the function ext4_get_blocks_handle()
	  is re-interpreted as a snapshot block command argument.  The old
	  argument values 0(=read) and 1(=create) preserve the original
	  behavior of the function.  The bit field h_cowing in the current
	  transaction handle is used to prevent COW recursions.

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK_COW
	bool "snapshot block operation - copy blocks to snapshot"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK
	default y
	help
	  Implementation of copying blocks into a snapshot file.

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL
	bool "snapshot journaled"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK
	default y
	help
	  Ext4 snapshot operations are journaled inside the same transaction
	  with the file system operation that triggered them.


config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL_ERROR
	bool "snapshot journaled - record errors in journal"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL
	default y
	help
	  Ext4 error state is recorded in the journal super block and error
	  messages are recorder in free space after the journal super block.
	  Ext4 should be mounted with errors=remount-ro.
	  After a snapshot error, the file system will be in read-only mode.
	  The administrator must un-mount the file system and run fsck
	  to prevent data corruption.
	  Some places in Ext3 original code don't check for return value of
	  JBD functions.  Check for snapshot/journal errors in those places.



config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL_CREDITS
	bool "snapshot journaled - increase transaction credits"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL
	default y
	help
	  Snapshot operations are journaled as part of the running transaction.
	  The amount of requested credits is multiplied with a factor, to ensure
	  that enough buffer credits are reserved in the running transaction.


config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL_RELEASE
	bool "snapshot journaled - implement journal_release_buffer()"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL
	default y
	help
	  The API journal_release_buffer() is called to cancel a previous call
	  to journal_get_write_access() and to recall the used buffer credit.
	  Current implementation of journal_release_buffer() in JBD is empty,
	  since no buffer credits are used until the buffer is marked dirty.
	  However, since the resulting snapshot COW operation cannot be undone,
	  we try to extend the current transaction to compensate for the used
	  credits of the extra COW operation, so we don't run out of buffer
	  credits too soon.


config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL_BYPASS
	bool "snapshot journaled - bypass to save credits"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL
	default y
	help
	  Don't journal COW bitmap indirect blocks to save journal credits.
	  On very few COW operations (i.e., first block group access after
	  snapshot take), there may be up to 3 extra blocks allocated for the
	  active snapshot (i.e., COW bitmap block and up to 2 indirect blocks).
	  Taking these 3 extra allocations into account on every COW operation
	  would further increase the transaction's COW credits factor.
	  Instead, we choose to pay a small performance penalty on these few
	  COW bitmap operations and wait until they are synced to disk.

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL_CACHE
	bool "snapshot journaled - cache last COW tid in journal_head"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL
	default y
	help
	  Cache last COW transaction id in buffer's journal_head.
	  The cache suppresses COW tests until the transaction in committed. By default, the running transaction is committed every 5 seconds
	  which implies an average COW cache expiry of 2.5 seconds.
	  Before taking a new snapshot, the journal is flushed to disk
	  and the current transaction in committed, so the COW cache is
	  invalidated (as it should be).

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL_TRACE
	bool "snapshot journaled - trace COW/buffer credits"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_JOURNAL
	depends on EXT4_FS_DEBUG
	default y

	  Extra debug prints to trace snapshot usage of buffer credits.

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_LIST
	bool "snapshot list support"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_FILE
	default y
	help
	  Implementation of multiple incremental snapshots.
	  Snapshot inodes are chained on a list starting at the super block,
	  both on-disk and in-memory, similar to the orphan inodes.  We reuse
	  the orphan inode list functions to manipulate the snapshot list.
	  Unlink and truncate of snapshot inodes on the list is not allowed,
	  so an inode can never be chained on both orphan and snapshot lists.
	  We make use of this fact to overload the in-memory inode field
	  ext4_inode_info.i_orphan for the chaining of snapshots.


config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_CTL_INIT
	bool "snapshot control - init new snapshot"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_CTL
	default y
	help
	  On snapshot create, a few special blocks (i.e., the super block and
	  group descriptors) are pre-allocated and on snapshot take, they are
	  copied under journal_lock_updates().  This is done to avoid the
	  recursion that would be caused by COWing these blocks after the
	  snapshot becomes active.

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_CTL_FIX
	bool "snapshot control - fix new snapshot"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_CTL_INIT
	default y
	help
	  On snapshot take, after copying the pre-allocated blocks, some are
	  fixed to make the snapshot image appear as a valid Ext2 file system.
	  The has_journal and has_snapshot flags are cleared from the super
	  block as well as the journal inode and last snapshot inode fields.
	  All snapshot inodes are cleared (to appear as empty inodes).

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_CTL_RESERVE
	bool "snapshot control - reserve disk space for snapshot"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_CTL
	default y
	help
	  Ensure there is enough disk space for snapshot file future use.

	  size, number of directories and number of blocks/inodes in use.

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_CTL_DUMP

	  Snapshot debugging should be enabled.
config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK_MOVE
	bool "snapshot block operation - move blocks to snapshot"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK
	default y
	help
	  Implementation of moving blocks into a snapshot file.
	  The move block command maps an allocated blocks to the snapshot file,
	  allocating only the indirect blocks when needed.
	  This mechanism is used to move-on-write data blocks to snapshot.

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK_BITMAP
	bool "snapshot block operation - copy block bitmap to snapshot"
	depends on EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK
	default y
	help
	  The snapshot copy of the file system block bitmap is called the COW
	  bitmap and it is used to check if a block was allocated at the time
	  that the snapshot was taken.

config EXT4_FS_SNAPSHOT_CTL
