---------------------- Reverting back to old commits --------------------------

The “revert” command basically reverses whatever changes made in the 
commit passed in by creating a new commit. So, you wanted to revert 
the last commit you just made on your current branch:

$ git revert HEAD
Finished one revert.
[master 2f74048] Revert "Third commit"

By default using this command will bring up your $EDITOR so you can 
modify the commit message of the revert. Use this to explain why the 
changes are being backed out! If for some reason you don’t want to 
edit the commit message, tacking on --no-edit will allow you do so.

Another helpful option is the -n or --no-commit flag. This will 
simply leave the reverted changes in your working directory and 
not automatically commit them.

If you need to edit files further to complete the revert or possibly 
revert more than one commit, try out this option.
Dealing with reverting merges is somewhat irksome. You may receive 
this message when trying to revert one:

$ git revert HEAD~1
fatal: Commit xxxxxxx is a merge but no -m option was given.

With merges, you need to pick one of the merged in commits to revert. 
By using the -m or --mainline option, you can pick out which commit 
should be part of the ‘mainline’. This requires a number argument, 
which is a bit misleading. Let’s look at the merge commit shown above:

$ git log HEAD~1 -1
commit c8f5e242a0d571d53f7ffb441aba7aa0e4e1539d
Author: Piyush Nimbalkar <piyushmnimbalkar@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 3 23:38:09 2010 +0530

    Third commit

Basically, if we do git revert HEAD~1 -m 1, you’ll get the first 
commit in the merge reverted (5f576a9). Using -m 2 will revert the 
second commit (62db4af). It’s just a matter of figuring out which 
commit you need to roll back. The default commit message shows the 
commit that was reverted as well.


$ git revert HEAD~1 --no-edit --mainline 1
commit 2f74048a7d309dec5d7e26276beae581efca2238
Author: Piyush Nimbalkar <piyushmnimbalkar@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 4 01:06:42 2010 +0530

    Revert "third commit"
    
    This reverts commit c8f5e242a0d571d53f7ffb441aba7aa0e4e1539d.
